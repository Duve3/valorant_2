# valorant_2(d)
Valorant_2(d) is a 2d version of valorant. We thought of the idea after looking at [this scratch game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/414069875/)
which seemed a unique and good idea to port to python using **pygame**.

### How does it work
The overall game is just a simple pygame game, it's the multiplayer part that becomes difficult.

Our server is using **JSON** to transmit data to clients, if you would like to have a deeper look at it then look at SERVER/server.py and SERVER/testClient/testClient.py
